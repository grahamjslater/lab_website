__Graham Slater__: I'm a macroevolutionary paleobiologist with interests in the tempo and mode of ecomorphological diversification across space and time. I use data from living and extinct species to address these questions, typically rooted in a phylogenetic framework. Although I'm interested in general questions about evolutionary pattern and process and my students work on diverse systems, most of my own work has focused on mammalian evolution, particularly the order Carnivora.

</div>

[__Dr. Jonathan Nations__](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/people/jonathan-nations/) (NSF Post-Doctoral Fellow 2021-2024). Jon is currently Assistant Curator of Mammalogy at the Florida Museum of Natural History (University of Florida) where he continues to use field collections, observations, and museum specimens to examine the drivers of morphological variation, primarily using small mammals as model systems. Jon is increasingly interested in the use of complex statistical models, such as Bayesian multi-level models, and Artificial Intelligence approaches for addressing macroevolutionary and ecological questions.

[__Dr. Rossy Natale__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossy-natale-671b79103/) (PhD 2023 Integrative Biology): Rossy studied the evolution of functional and ecological morphological variation in charadriiform birds and the implications of that variation for community assembly and on potential responses to climate change. Rossy is now a postdoctoral associate at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, where she is continuing to use spatial statistical approaches to study the implications of human activity for bird populations.
